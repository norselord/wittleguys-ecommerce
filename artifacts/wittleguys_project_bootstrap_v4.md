# Wittleguys Ecommerce Project: Bootstrap Context v4

## Workflow & Environment
- **Development OS:** Arch Linux laptop (main dev machine, runs Hugo server for local testing)
- **AI/Code Assistance:** Windows desktop (Claude, Cursor IDE) accessed via RDP from Arch laptop
- **Production Hosting:** Vultr VPS running Debian server
- **Web Server:** Nginx serves static site and proxies API requests to backend on port 3001
- **Deployment:** Use `rsync` to push updated static site and backend code from Arch laptop to Debian VPS

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Hugo static site generator with custom HTML/CSS/JS
- **Backend:** Node.js Express server (for Stripe Checkout) on port 3001
- **Payments:** Stripe integration (currently test mode, ready for live mode)
- **Cart:** Off-canvas drawer with localStorage persistence, modern UI with add/remove/quantity controls
- **Product Data:** Markdown files in `content/products/` with images, prices, and Stripe price IDs

## Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

### Recently Completed (Working Perfectly):
- **Cart Functionality:** Add/remove items, quantity controls, localStorage persistence
- **Stripe Integration:** Test payments processing successfully
- **Success Page:** Professional order confirmation page with cart clearing
- **Cancel Flow:** Proper handling of cancelled payments (returns to homepage with cart intact)
- **Product Display:** All 3 products showing correctly with images and prices
- **Navigation:** Dropdowns, custom logo, favicon, responsive design

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **Cart Clearing Issue:** ✅ FIXED - Cart now clears automatically after successful checkout
2. **Success Page:** ✅ FIXED - Professional order confirmation page loads properly
3. **Cancel URL:** ✅ FIXED - Stripe back arrow returns to homepage correctly

- **✅ Product Pages:** All clickable with proper images/descriptions

## Environment Configuration:
**Current .env (Test Mode):**
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:1313
PORT=3001
```

**Production .env (Ready):**
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Ready for Production Deployment:
- **Stripe Test Mode:** Fully functional and tested
- **Live Mode Preparation:** Need to switch API keys and update Hugo config
- **Backend:** Ready for rsync deployment to Debian VPS
- **Frontend:** Static site ready for deployment

## Outstanding Pre-Launch Tasks:

### 1. Final Testing (Optional but Recommended):
- **Different Card Scenarios:** Test declined cards, expired cards, 3D Secure
- **Edge Cases:** Test with different quantities, product combinations
- **Browser Testing:** Verify functionality across different browsers
- **Mobile Testing:** Ensure responsive design works on mobile devices

### 2. Production Deployment:
- **Switch to Live Stripe Keys:** Update both backend .env and Hugo config
- **Deploy via rsync:** Push code to Vultr VPS
- **Configure Production Environment:** Set up .env on server
- **Update Nginx:** Ensure proper routing for production domain
- **SSL Certificate:** Ensure HTTPS is configured
- **Test Production:** Verify everything works on live server

### 3. Launch Checklist:
- **Domain Configuration:** Ensure domain points to VPS
- **Email Configuration:** Verify Stripe emails work in live mode
- **Backup Strategy:** Ensure regular backups of VPS
- **Monitoring:** Set up basic monitoring for uptime

## Key Context for Next Developer/Claude:
- **Core functionality is 100% working** - ready for production
- **All major bugs resolved** - cart clearing, success page, cancel flow
- **Stripe integration tested and functional** in test mode
- **Workflow is cross-platform:** Arch for dev, Windows for AI, Debian for production
- **Deployment method:** rsync from Arch to Debian VPS
- **Current priority:** Final testing and production deployment

## What Claude Should Help With Next:
1. **Guide through comprehensive testing** of edge cases if desired
2. **Assist with switching to Stripe live mode** safely
3. **Help with production deployment** process and checklist
4. **Provide post-launch monitoring and maintenance** guidance
5. **Handle any final UI/UX tweaks** or feature requests

## Financial Impact:
- **Ready to start generating revenue** - all payment processing functional
- **No blocking issues** - site is ready for customers
- **Professional checkout experience** - builds customer confidence
